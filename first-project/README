- Setup persons repository:
    - Add required spring dependencies to pom.xml
    - Create beans configuration in resources directory
    - Setup spring ClassPathXmlApplicationContext using context configuration
    - Retrieve implementation of persons repository from context, add two users

- Setup tax service using its implementation in 2015:
    - Inject flat tax level to property
    - Inject reference to persons repository
    - Retrieve reference to tax service and calculate tax for added person

- Check how it works
    - Use http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/html/overview.html#overview-logging-log4j to add support for Log4j
    - Set debug level for classes in org.springframework.beans.factory
    - Remove id for your bean and find its autogenerated name
    - Add few names to bean (separate them with ';', ',' or ' ' and check if it really works
    - Use debugger to trace the process of creating context
    - Find in AbstractApplicationContext place where BeanFactory is created and find where it has map of all beans
    - Find place where bean is instantiated

- Make fun:
    - Split beans configurations into two separate configuration files and load both of them
    - Add another configuration, import two separate configuration and load only composing configuration
